Long ago in Ireland there were many kings there lived a widow who has only one daughter.
When the daughter was young she was very delicate so her mother never asked her to do any work.
When she grew up she was not accustomed of doing any work so she would not do any then.
Her mother was so angry with her one once occasion that she gave her a beating.
