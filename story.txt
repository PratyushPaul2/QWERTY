Long ago in Ireland there were many kings there lived a widow who has only one daughter.
When the daughter was young she was very delicate so her mother never asked her to do any work.
When she grew up she was not accustomed of doing any work so she would not do any then.
Her mother was so angry with her one once occasion that she gave her a beating.
At this time a prince happened to be passing the house and he heard the girl crying. 
He went to the house and asked why was she crying.
The mother was ashamed so she said that she beat her because she was doing too much work.
On hearing this the prince asked her to let her go to the palace and she would be very useful
